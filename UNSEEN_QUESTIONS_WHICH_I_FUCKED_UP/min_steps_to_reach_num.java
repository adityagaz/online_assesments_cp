          You are given a number n. At the start you are at zero 
          and in step i you can add i to the current_number or you can subtract i from the current number
          you have to return the min cost to reach the desired number n.
          Cost increments by step at each step

          ex- 
          n = 4

          intially 
          num = 0 //you are at 0                                , num = 0
          now you can go to 1 or -1 after step 1 cost = 0 +1 = 1 , num = -1
          then in step 2 you can go from -1 to 1 cost = 1 + 2 = 3 , num = 1
          then in the next step 3 you can go from 1 to 4 = 3 + 3 = 6 num = 4

          now since you have reached the target num = 4 you can return cost 6


          TEST CASES - 
          N=3 ANS = 3
          N=5 ANS = 15


          Constraints 
          -1e9 <= n <= 1e9
