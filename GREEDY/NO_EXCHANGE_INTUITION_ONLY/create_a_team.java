    Question -
    You are given two arrays speed , efficiency of n people who appeared for interviews.
    Now you have to select k people out of them such that the sum of efficiencies of k people in team and their speed is maximum 


    Observation 1 - 
    We can't apply greedy exchange arguments here
    because we donot know whether our swapped element is in the team of k or not.

    Observation 2 - The overall speed of the team will be decided by the person who is the slowest.
    because we can observe in daily life also

    Now we have to minimmize -- sigma (1 ... k (summation(efficiencies(i)) * min(speed(i)));

    Since we have a complex function to minimize we can just think about on which element we can iterate
    Since we can fix a speed and say we can want team to be atleast this speed (greedy observation)

    sort by speed 
    now we have to see that at each index i speed[i] will be the minimum speed for all the teams starting from 
    i .... N
    And for best people we can do a top k elements from n to i.
    Then we will multiply the speed[i] * (sum of top k elements at index i)

    For maintaining top k elements we have to use a variable that tracks the sum of top k elements at index i

    For top k elements we can maintain a priority queue.
    At last take the max of answers at each index and return that answer

    Conclusions -- It is not a local optimization problem so we cannot use exchange arguments here
    2. When we have to minimize or maximize a complex function on what we can iterate and then solve for other

    Bonus tip -- if two things are changing ... stop one completely and then check... works most of the time.
